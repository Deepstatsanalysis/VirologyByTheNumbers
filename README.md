# VirologyByTheNumbers
This is a series of code, data, and text files that accompany the manuscript "Viral Genomes by the Numbers: A Comprehensive Quantitative Exploration of Thousands of Viruses" by Gita Mahmoudabadi and Rob Phillips. 

There are lots of dependencies for this project. Most of the code will require the following (assuming an Anaconda installation; though this is by no means necessary):
1) ete-toolkit (3.0) be installed. 
2) numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas be installed. (conda install pandas)
3) seaborn be installed. (conda install seaborn)
4) biopython be installed. (conda install biopython)
5) The following are in the working directory (i.e. the directory that the script is in): all_rpt, all_ptt, all_faa, folderToHostTaxid.txt
6) Python 3.4+
